# Tasks for lesson 3
Here are some tasks for you, based on the related lesson. These tasks are not tests but a way to just get started. Some tasks are things I stumbled upon myself while coding. It's always okay to check out the source of the lesson because it should (hopefully) be correct.

## Task 1
Can you change the duration of the growing animation?

## Task 2
Can you change the order of the shrinking and growing? It's hard to see what's up when the animation is finished with all the big squares everywhere :)

## Task 3
What happens when you place a tag in the middle of another animation?
