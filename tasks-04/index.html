        <section>
          It can be quite confusing to animate classes. You have probably
          noticed that all squares get animated because they have the box class.
          It's better to just assign an id to each box and add them to the
          animation as elements in an array. Let's not animate based on
          css-classes (style) but based on elements. It's a preference, and
          sometimes you want to animate everything that is '.green' or '.box'
          but it can be confusing if you change the color of a box and the
          animation suddenly changes. I think box no 5 (from the top) is a great
          example here. We probably want to change the color of that box because
          it's the same as the background color - making it hard to see. If we
          remove the `bg-beige` class in favour of something else the animation
          will be lost as a side effect. A neat bonus is that the markup will be
          cleaner.
