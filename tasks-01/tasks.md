# Tasks for lesson 1
Here are some tasks for you, based on the related lesson. These tasks are not tests but a way to just get started. Some tasks are things I stumbled upon myself while coding. It's always okay to check out the source of the lesson because it should (hopefully) give a hint how to do stuff.

## Task 1
The styling is gone, can you figure out why? It would be nice to see some boxes :)

## Task 2
The button isn't working, and the console logs an error. Can you fix it? Hint: it's important where to load the javascript correctly.

## Task 3
Can you fix the animations so that everything stays on screen when the animation ends?
