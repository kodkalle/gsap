# Tasks for lesson 2
Here are some tasks for you, based on the related lesson. These tasks are not tests but a way to just get started. Some tasks are things I stumbled upon myself while coding. It's always okay to check out the source of the lesson because it should (hopefully) be correct.

## Task 1
The animation is quite slow, can you change it to be quicker?

## Task 2
There's functions in gsap that allows a timeline to play(), pause(), resume(), reverse() and restart(). Can you add the missing buttons and functionality? Hint: stop the animation when you render the page.

const tl = gsap.timeline({paused: true);

## Task 3
Can you change the animation to be circles instead? Use a class called circle.

## Task 4
Can you align the boxes horizontally and change all animations to move vertically?
